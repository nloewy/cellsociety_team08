    <display_description>The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. Its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine. The Toad is a 6-cell oscillator discovered by Simon Norton in 1970. It is one of the few known oscillators that is a polyomino in one of its phases. The Toad has multiple applications, is notable for its role as a catalyst, and it often appears in large, complex patterns. It can be used as a building block for constructing large oscillators with an even period due to its versatility.</display_description>
