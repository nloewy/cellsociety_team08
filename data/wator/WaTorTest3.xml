    <display_description>Wator is a simulation based on a discrete model of predator-prey interaction. It was originally described by Alexander K. Dewdney in the Scientific American magazine. It simulates the hypothetical toroidal Planet Wa-Tor (Water Torus) whose surface is entirely covered with water, occupied by two species: fish and sharks. The sharks are the predators that eat the fish. Fish move randomly, reproduce according to a certain rate, lives on a never ending supply of plankton, and die if eaten by shark; while sharks move randomly, lose energy by moving, and gain energy by eating fish, and spawn offspring if energy is sufficient. </display_description>
