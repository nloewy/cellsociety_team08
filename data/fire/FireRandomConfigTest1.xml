  <display_description>The forest-fire model is a mathematical simulation of wildfires' self-organization. It operates on a grid with empty cells, trees, and burning cells. The key parameter is the ratio of planted trees to ignition probability, impacting wildfire patterns. In ecology, it illustrates how vegetation arrangement influences real-world wildfires.</display_description>
