## Overview

In our program, we hope to model 5 different kinds of Cellular Automata (CA). In the Cell Society project, we hope that our final implementation of our code, we will be able to model any form of Cellular Automata relatively easily, regardless of any transition functions, parameters, or use cases. We hope to do this by writing generalizable, extendable, and modular code, as we have discussed in CS308.

On a higher level, we hope to break down our code into three different sections. The model section of our codebase will house all of our core algorithms, including the code for simulating these automata, and the basic units for these automata â€“ Cells. The view section of our codebase will contain code for our user interface, which we will build using JavaFX. Lastly, the config package will enable our code to read and write XML files, so we can load, save configurations and the state of our simulations.
